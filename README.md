# Coding-Challenge

Code flow:

2 objects 
Object 1: contains the name of the product
Object 2 : contains the prices of the product

check function that loops of over the objects to check for the right amount and name.

add function has a counter that increases per click.

calculate function multiplies the price of the product with the counter # (only works if check function is valid)

remove function removes one counter then runs the calculate function again

total function gets all values from the corresponding functions (name, prime, total amount) and inputs it to the table.

Remove function removes the specific values of the row it is on.
